{"slug":"octal-to-binary","markdown":"\n## What is Octal?\n\nOctal is a number system that uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. It is also known as base 8 numbering system since it is based on 8 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.\n\n## What is Binary?\n\nBinary is a number system that uses two digits: 0 and 1. It is also known as base 2 numbering system since it is based on 2 following symbols: 0 and 1.\n\n## How to convert Octal to Binary?\n\nTo convert Octal to Binary, we need to convert each Octal value to it's Binary value using the Binary table.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the Octal value `12` to Binary.\n\nFirst, we need to convert each Octal value to it's Binary value.\n\n| Octal Value | Binary Value |\n| ----------- | ------------ |\n| 1           | 001          |\n| 2           | 010          |\n\nNow, we need to combine all the Binary values together to get the final Binary value. In this case, the final Binary value is `001010`. This is the Binary representation of the Octal value `12`.\n"}
