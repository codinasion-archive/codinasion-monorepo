{"slug":"decimal-to-ascii","markdown":"\n## What is Decimal?\n\nDecimal is a number system that uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. It is also known as base 10 numbering system since it is based on 10 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.\n\n## What is ASCII?\n\nASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.\n\n## How to convert Decimal to ASCII?\n\nTo convert Decimal to ASCII, we need to convert each Decimal value to it's ASCII character using the ASCII table.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the Decimal value `72 101 108 108 111` to ASCII.\n\nFirst, we need to convert each Decimal value to it's ASCII character.\n\n| Decimal Value | Character |\n| ------------- | --------- |\n| 72            | H         |\n| 101           | e         |\n| 108           | l         |\n| 108           | l         |\n| 111           | o         |\n\nNow, we need to combine all the ASCII characters together to get the final ASCII value. In this case, the final ASCII value is `Hello`. This is the ASCII representation of the Decimal value `72 101 108 108 111`.\n"}
