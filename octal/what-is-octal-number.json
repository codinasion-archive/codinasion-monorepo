This means that each digit in an octal number represents a power of 8. Octal numbers are not as commonly used as [decimal][Decimal_Number] or [hexadecimal numbers][Hexadecimal_Number], but they are still used in some areas of computing.\n\nIn the octal numbering system, the digits 0-7 represent the values 0-7. For example, the octal number 123 can be represented as:\n\n$$1 \\times 8^2 + 2 \\times 8^1 + 3 \\times 8^0$$\n\nIn this representation, the first digit (1) represents 64 ($1 \\times 8^2$), the second digit (2) represents 16 ($2 \\times 8^1$), and the third digit (3) represents 3 ($3 \\times 8^0$). When you add these values together, you get the decimal number 83.\n\n$$1 \\times 8^2 + 2 \\times 8^1 + 3 \\times 8^0 = 64 + 16 + 3 = 83$$\n\nIn addition to octal numbers, there are other numbering systems, such as [binary][Binary_Number] and [hexadecimal][Hexadecimal_Number], that are used in computing. However, octal numbers are not as commonly used as these other numbering systems.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following table shows the decimal, binary & octal representations of the numbers 0 through 7:\n\n| Decimal | Binary | Octal |\n| ------- | ------ | ----- |\n| 0       | 000    | 0     |\n| 1       | 001    | 1     |\n| 2       | 010    | 2     |\n| 3       | 011    | 3     |\n| 4       | 100    | 4     |\n| 5       | 101    | 5     |\n| 6       | 110    | 6     |\n| 7       | 111    | 7     |\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- [Octal Number Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal)\n- [Binary Number][Binary_Number]\n- [Decimal Number][Decimal_Number]\n- [Hexadecimal Number][Hexadecimal_Number]\n\n[Binary_Number]: /blog/2024/01/01-what-is-binary-number \"What is a Binary Number?\"\n[Decimal_Number]: /blog/2024/01/01-what-is-decimal-number \"What is a Decimal Number?\"\n[Hexadecimal_Number]: /blog/2024/01/01-what-is-hexadecimal-number \"What is a Hexadecimal Number?\"\n"}
