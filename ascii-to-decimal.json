{"slug":"ascii-to-decimal","markdown":"\n## What is ASCII?\n\nASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.\n\n## What is Decimal?\n\nDecimal is a number system that uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. It is also known as base 10 numbering system since it is based on 10 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.\n\n## How to convert ASCII to Decimal?\n\nTo convert ASCII to Decimal, we need to convert each character to it's Decimal value using the ASCII table.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the word \"Hello\" to Decimal.\n\nFirst, we need to convert each character to it's Decimal value.\n\n| Character | Decimal Value |\n| --------- | ------------- |\n| H         | 72            |\n| e         | 101           |\n| l         | 108           |\n| l         | 108           |\n| o         | 111           |\n\nNow, we need to combine all the Decimal values together to get the final Decimal value. In this case, the final Decimal value is `72 101 108 108 111`. This is the Decimal representation of the word \"Hello\".\n"}
