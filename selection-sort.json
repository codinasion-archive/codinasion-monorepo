{"slug":"selection-sort","markdown":"\n## What is Selection Sort?\n\nSelection sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts a collection of elements by selecting the smallest element in the collection and then swapping it with the first element in the collection.\n\n## How to implement Selection Sort?\n\nTo implement selection sort, we need to select the smallest element in the collection and then swap it with the first element in the collection.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's sort the collection `[3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1]` using selection sort.\n\nFirst, we need to select the smallest element in the collection and then swap it with the first element in the collection.\n\n| Element | Selection | Swap |\n| ------- | --------- | ---- |\n| 3       | 1         | 1    |\n| 2       | 1         | 1    |\n| 4       | 1         | 1    |\n| 1       | 1         | 1    |\n| 2       | 1         | 1    |\n| 1       |           |      |\n\nThe sorted collection is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`.\n"}
