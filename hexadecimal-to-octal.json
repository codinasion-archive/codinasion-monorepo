{"slug":"hexadecimal-to-octal","markdown":"\n## What is Hexadecimal?\n\nHexadecimal is a number system that uses sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F. It is also known as base 16 numbering system since it is based on 16 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.\n\n## What is Octal?\n\nOctal is a number system that uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. It is also known as base 8 numbering system since it is based on 8 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.\n\n## How to convert Hexadecimal to Octal?\n\nTo convert Hexadecimal to Octal, we need to convert each Hexadecimal value to it's Octal value using the Hexadecimal to Octal table.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the Hexadecimal value `48 65 6C 6C 6F` to Octal.\n\nFirst, we need to convert each Hexadecimal value to it's Octal value.\n\n| Hexadecimal Value | Octal Value |\n| ----------------- | ----------- |\n| 48                | 110         |\n| 65                | 145         |\n| 6C                | 154         |\n| 6C                | 154         |\n| 6F                | 157         |\n\nNow, we need to combine all the Octal values together to get the final Octal value. In this case, the final Octal value is `110 145 154 154 157`. This is the Octal representation of the Hexadecimal value `48 65 6C 6C 6F`.\n"}
