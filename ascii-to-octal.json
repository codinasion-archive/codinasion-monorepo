{"slug":"ascii-to-octal","markdown":"\n## What is ASCII?\n\nASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.\n\n## What is Octal?\n\nOctal is a number system that uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. It is also known as base 8 numbering system since it is based on 8 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\n## How to convert ASCII to Octal?\n\nTo convert ASCII to Octal, we need to convert each character to it's ASCII value, then convert that ASCII value to Octal.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the word \"Hello\" to Octal.\n\nFirst, we need to convert each character to it's ASCII value.\n\n| Character | ASCII Value |\n| --------- | ----------- |\n| H         | 72          |\n| e         | 101         |\n| l         | 108         |\n| l         | 108         |\n| o         | 111         |\n\nNow, we need to convert each ASCII value to Octal.\n\n| ASCII Value | Octal Value |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| 72          | 110         |\n| 101         | 145         |\n| 108         | 154         |\n| 108         | 154         |\n| 111         | 157         |\n\nFinally, we need to combine all the Octal values together to get the final Octal value. In this case, the final Octal value is `110 145 154 154 157`. This is the Octal representation of the word \"Hello\".\n"}
