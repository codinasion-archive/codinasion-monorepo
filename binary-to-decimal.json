Computers operate in binary, meaning they store data and perform calculations using only zeros and ones.\n\n## What is Decimal?\n\nDecimal is a number system that uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. It is also known as base 10 numbering system since it is based on 10 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.\n\n## How to convert Binary to Decimal?\n\nTo convert Binary to Decimal, we need to multiply each binary digit by it's place value, then add up all the results.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the binary value `1001101` to Decimal.\n\nFirst, we need to multiply each binary digit by it's place value.\n\n| Binary Digit | Place Value | Result |\n| ------------ | ----------- | ------ |\n| 1            | $2^6$       | 64     |\n| 0            | $2^5$       | 0      |\n| 0            | $2^4$       | 0      |\n| 1            | $2^3$       | 8      |\n| 1            | $2^2$       | 4      |\n| 0            | $2^1$       | 0      |\n| 1            | $2^0$       | 1      |\n\nNow, we need to add up all the results.\n\n$64 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 77$\n\nFinally, we need to add up all the results. In this case, the final Decimal value is `77`. This is the Decimal representation of the binary value `1001101`.\n"}
