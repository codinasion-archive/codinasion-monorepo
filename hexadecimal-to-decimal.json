It is also known as base 10 numbering system since it is based on 10 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.\n\n## How to convert Hexadecimal to Decimal?\n\nTo convert Hexadecimal to Decimal, we need to convert each Hexadecimal value to it's Decimal value using the Hexadecimal to Decimal table.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the Hexadecimal value `48 65 6C 6C 6F` to Decimal.\n\nFirst, we need to convert each Hexadecimal value to it's Decimal value.\n\n| Hexadecimal Value | Decimal Value |\n| ----------------- | ------------- |\n| 48                | 72            |\n| 65                | 101           |\n| 6C                | 108           |\n| 6C                | 108           |\n| 6F                | 111           |\n\nNow, we need to combine all the Decimal values together to get the final Decimal value. In this case, the final Decimal value is `72 101 108 108 111`. This is the Decimal representation of the Hexadecimal value `48 65 6C 6C 6F`.\n"}
