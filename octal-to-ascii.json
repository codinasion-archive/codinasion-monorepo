{"slug":"octal-to-ascii","markdown":"\n## What is Octal?\n\nOctal is a number system that uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. It is also known as base 8 numbering system since it is based on 8 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.\n\n## What is ASCII?\n\nASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.\n\n## How to convert Octal to ASCII?\n\nTo convert Octal to ASCII, we need to convert each Octal value to it's ASCII character using the ASCII table.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the Octal value `110 145 154 154 157` to ASCII.\n\nFirst, we need to convert each Octal value to it's ASCII character.\n\n| Octal Value | Character |\n| ----------- | --------- |\n| 110         | H         |\n| 145         | e         |\n| 154         | l         |\n| 154         | l         |\n| 157         | o         |\n\nNow, we need to combine all the ASCII characters together to get the final ASCII value. In this case, the final ASCII value is `Hello`. This is the ASCII representation of the Octal value `110 145 154 154 157`.\n"}
