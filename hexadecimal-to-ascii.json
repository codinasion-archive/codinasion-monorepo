{"slug":"hexadecimal-to-ascii","markdown":"\n## What is Hexadecimal?\n\nHexadecimal is a number system that uses sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F. It is also known as base 16 numbering system since it is based on 16 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.\n\n## What is ASCII?\n\nASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.\n\n## How to convert Hexadecimal to ASCII?\n\nTo convert Hexadecimal to ASCII, we need to convert each Hexadecimal value to it's ASCII character using the ASCII table.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the Hexadecimal value `48 65 6C 6C 6F` to ASCII.\n\nFirst, we need to convert each Hexadecimal value to it's ASCII character.\n\n| Hexadecimal Value | Character |\n| ----------------- | --------- |\n| 48                | H         |\n| 65                | e         |\n| 6C                | l         |\n| 6C                | l         |\n| 6F                | o         |\n\nNow, we need to combine all the ASCII characters together to get the final ASCII value. In this case, the final ASCII value is `Hello`. This is the ASCII representation of the Hexadecimal value `48 65 6C 6C 6F`.\n"}
