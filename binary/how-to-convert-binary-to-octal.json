Binary is a `base-2` number system that uses only two digits, 0 and 1. Octal, on the other hand, is a `base-8` number system that uses eight digits, 0 through 7. Converting binary to octal involves grouping the binary digits into groups of 3 and converting each group to its corresponding octal value.\n\n## Conversion\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to convert binary to octal:\n\n1. Choose the binary number you want to convert to octal.\n2. Group the binary digits into groups of 3, starting from the rightmost digit. If the leftmost group has less than 3 digits, pad it with leading zeros.\n3. Convert each group of 3 binary digits to its corresponding octal value using the table below.\n\n## Example\n\nLet's walk through an example to illustrate the process. Suppose we want to convert the binary number 11011010 to octal.\n\n1. The binary number we want to convert is `11011010`.\n2. We group the binary digits into groups of 3: `011` and `011` and `010`.\n3. We convert each group of 3 binary digits to its corresponding octal value using the table below. The octal value of `011` is `3`, and the octal value of `010` is `2`.\n4. The octal representation of the binary number `11011010` is `332`.\n\n## Binary-Octal Table\n\n| Binary | Octal |\n| ------ | ----- |\n| 000    | 0     |\n| 001    | 1     |\n| 010    | 2     |\n| 011    | 3     |\n| 100    | 4     |\n| 101    | 5     |\n| 110    | 6     |\n| 111    | 7     |\n\n## References\n\n- [Binary Number][Binary_Number]\n- [Octal Number][Octal_Number]\n\n<!-- Reference -->\n\n[Binary_Number]: /blog/2024/01/01-what-is-binary-number \"What is a Binary Number?\"\n[Octal_Number]: /blog/2024/01/01-what-is-octal-number \"What is an Octal Number?\"\n"}
