This is in contrast to the [decimal][Decimal_Number] (`base-10`) numeral system that we use in everyday life, which uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\nIn the binary system, each digit represents a power of 2, starting with $2^0$ (which is equal to 1) and increasing by a factor of 2 for each successive digit. For example, the binary number 1011 represents:\n\n$$1 \\times 2^3 + 0 \\times 2^2 + 1 \\times 2^1 + 1 \\times 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11$$\n\nBinary numbers are commonly used in computer science and digital electronics because they can be easily represented using electronic switches that are either on or off (i.e., 1 or 0). This makes them ideal for representing digital data, such as the instructions that a computer executes or the pixels in a digital image.\n\nIn addition to binary, there are other numeral systems that use different bases, such as [octal][Octal_Number] (`base-8`) and [hexadecimal][Hexadecimal_Number] (`base-16`). These systems are also commonly used in computer science and digital electronics because they can be easily converted to and from binary.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following table shows the decimal, binary representations of the numbers 0 through 15:\n\n| Decimal | Binary |\n| ------- | ------ |\n| 0       | 0000   |\n| 1       | 0001   |\n| 2       | 0010   |\n| 3       | 0011   |\n| 4       | 0100   |\n| 5       | 0101   |\n| 6       | 0110   |\n| 7       | 0111   |\n| 8       | 1000   |\n| 9       | 1001   |\n| 10      | 1010   |\n| 11      | 1011   |\n| 12      | 1100   |\n| 13      | 1101   |\n| 14      | 1110   |\n| 15      | 1111   |\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- [Binary Number Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number)\n- [Decimal Number][Decimal_Number]\n- [Hexadecimal Number][Hexadecimal_Number]\n- [Octal Number][Octal_Number]\n\n<!-- Reference -->\n\n[Decimal_Number]: /blog/2024/01/01-what-is-decimal-number \"What is a Decimal Number?\"\n[Hexadecimal_Number]: /blog/2024/01/01-what-is-hexadecimal-number \"What is a Hexadecimal Number?\"\n[Octal_Number]: /blog/2024/01/01-what-is-octal-number \"What is an Octal Number?\"\n"}
