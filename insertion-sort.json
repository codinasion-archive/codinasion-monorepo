{"slug":"insertion-sort","markdown":"\n## What is Insertion Sort?\n\nInsertion sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts a collection of elements by inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted collection.\n\n## How to implement Insertion Sort?\n\nTo implement insertion sort, we need to insert each element into its correct position in the sorted collection.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's sort the collection `[3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1]` using insertion sort.\n\nFirst, we need to insert each element into its correct position in the sorted collection.\n\n| Element | Sorted Collection |\n| ------- | ----------------- |\n| 3       | 3                 |\n| 2       | 2, 3              |\n| 4       | 2, 3, 4           |\n| 1       | 1, 2, 3, 4        |\n| 2       | 1, 2, 2, 3, 4     |\n| 1       | 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4  |\n\nThe sorted collection is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`.\n"}
