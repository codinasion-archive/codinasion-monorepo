{"slug":"linear-search","markdown":"\n## What is Linear Search?\n\nLinear search is a search algorithm that searches for a target value in a collection of elements by iterating through each element in the collection until the target value is found or the end of the collection is reached.\n\n## How to implement Linear Search?\n\nTo implement linear search, we need to iterate through each element in the collection until the target value is found or the end of the collection is reached.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's search for the target value `3` in the collection `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` using linear search.\n\nFirst, we need to iterate through each element in the collection until the target value is found or the end of the collection is reached.\n\n| Element | Target Value | Is Found |\n| ------- | ------------ | -------- |\n| 1       | 3            | No       |\n| 2       | 3            | No       |\n| 3       | 3            | Yes      |\n\nThe target value `3` is found in the collection `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n"}
