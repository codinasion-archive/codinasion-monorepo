{"slug":"ascii-to-hexadecimal","markdown":"\n## What is ASCII?\n\nASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.\n\n## What is Hexadecimal?\n\nHexadecimal is a number system that uses sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. It is also known as base 16 numbering system since it is based on 16 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.\n\n## How to convert ASCII to Hexadecimal?\n\nTo convert ASCII to Hexadecimal, we need to convert each character to it's ASCII value, then convert that ASCII value to Hexadecimal.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the word \"Hello\" to Hexadecimal.\n\nFirst, we need to convert each character to it's ASCII value.\n\n| Character | ASCII Value |\n| --------- | ----------- |\n| H         | 72          |\n| e         | 101         |\n| l         | 108         |\n| l         | 108         |\n| o         | 111         |\n\nNow, we need to convert each ASCII value to Hexadecimal.\n\n| ASCII Value | Hexadecimal Value |\n| ----------- | ----------------- |\n| 72          | 48                |\n| 101         | 65                |\n| 108         | 6C                |\n| 108         | 6C                |\n| 111         | 6F                |\n\nFinally, we need to combine all the Hexadecimal values together to get the final Hexadecimal value. In this case, the final Hexadecimal value is `48 65 6C 6C 6F`. This is the Hexadecimal representation of the word \"Hello\".\n"}
