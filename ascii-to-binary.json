{"slug":"ascii-to-binary","markdown":"\n## What is ASCII?\n\nASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.\n\n## What is Binary?\n\nBinary is a number system that only uses two digits: 1 and 0. Computers operate in binary, meaning they store data and perform calculations using only zeros and ones.\n\n## How to convert ASCII to Binary?\n\nTo convert ASCII to Binary, we need to convert each character to it's ASCII value, then convert that ASCII value to binary.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the word \"Hello\" to binary.\n\nFirst, we need to convert each character to it's ASCII value.\n\n| Character | ASCII Value |\n| --------- | ----------- |\n| H         | 72          |\n| e         | 101         |\n| l         | 108         |\n| l         | 108         |\n| o         | 111         |\n\nNow, we need to convert each ASCII value to binary.\n\n| ASCII Value | Binary Value |\n| ----------- | ------------ |\n| 72          | 01001000     |\n| 101         | 01100101     |\n| 108         | 01101100     |\n| 108         | 01101100     |\n| 111         | 01101111     |\n\nFinally, we need to combine all the binary values together to get the final binary value. In this case, the final binary value is `0100100001100101011011000110110001101111`. This is the binary representation of the word \"Hello\".\n"}
