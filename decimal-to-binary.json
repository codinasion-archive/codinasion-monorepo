It is also known as base 10 numbering system since it is based on 10 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.\n\n## What is Binary?\n\nBinary is a number system that uses two digits: 0 and 1. It is also known as base 2 numbering system since it is based on 2 following symbols: 0 and 1.\n\n## How to convert Decimal to Binary?\n\nTo convert Decimal to Binary, we need to divide the Decimal value by 2 until the quotient is 0. Then, we need to combine all the remainders together to get the final Binary value.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the Decimal value `10` to Binary.\n\nFirst, we need to divide the Decimal value by 2 until the quotient is 0.\n\n| Decimal Value | Quotient | Remainder |\n| ------------- | -------- | --------- |\n| 10            | 5        | 0         |\n| 5             | 2        | 1         |\n| 2             | 1        | 0         |\n| 1             | 0        | 1         |\n\nNow, we need to combine all the remainders together to get the final Binary value. In this case, the final Binary value is `1010`. This is the Binary representation of the Decimal value `10`.\n"}
