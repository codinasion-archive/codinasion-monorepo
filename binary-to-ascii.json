{"slug":"binary-to-ascii","markdown":"\n## What is Binary?\n\nBinary is a number system that only uses two digits: 1 and 0. Computers operate in binary, meaning they store data and perform calculations using only zeros and ones.\n\n## What is ASCII?\n\nASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.\n\n## How to convert Binary to ASCII?\n\nTo convert Binary to ASCII, we need to convert each binary value to it's ASCII value, then convert that ASCII value to it's character.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the binary value `0100100001100101011011000110110001101111` to ASCII.\n\nFirst, we need to convert each binary value to it's ASCII value.\n\n| Binary Value | ASCII Value |\n| ------------ | ----------- |\n| 01001000     | 72          |\n| 01100101     | 101         |\n| 01101100     | 108         |\n| 01101100     | 108         |\n| 01101111     | 111         |\n\nNow, we need to convert each ASCII value to it's character.\n\n| ASCII Value | Character |\n| ----------- | --------- |\n| 72          | H         |\n| 101         | e         |\n| 108         | l         |\n| 108         | l         |\n| 111         | o         |\n\nFinally, we need to combine all the characters together to get the final word. In this case, the final word is `Hello`. This is the ASCII representation of the binary value `0100100001100101011011000110110001101111`.\n"}
