{"slug":"binary-to-hexadecimal","markdown":"\n## What is Binary?\n\nBinary is a number system that only uses two digits: 1 and 0. Computers operate in binary, meaning they store data and perform calculations using only zeros and ones.\n\n## What is Hexadecimal?\n\nHexadecimal is a number system that uses sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. It is also known as base 16 numbering system since it is based on 16 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.\n\n## How to convert Binary to Hexadecimal?\n\nTo convert Binary to Hexadecimal, we need to convert each group of four binary digits to it's Hexadecimal value.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the binary value `1001101` to Hexadecimal.\n\nFirst, we need to split the binary value into groups of four binary digits.\n\n| Binary Value | Grouped Binary Value |\n| ------------ | -------------------- |\n| 1001101      | 0001 0011 01         |\n\nNow, we need to convert each group of four binary digits to it's Hexadecimal value.\n\n| Grouped Binary Value | Hexadecimal Value |\n| -------------------- | ----------------- |\n| 0001                 | 1                 |\n| 0011                 | 3                 |\n| 01                   | 1                 |\n\nFinally, we need to combine all the Hexadecimal values together to get the final Hexadecimal value. In this case, the final Hexadecimal value is `131`. This is the Hexadecimal representation of the binary value `1001101`.\n"}
