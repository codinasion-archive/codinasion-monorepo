A hexadecimal number is a number that uses the `base-16` numbering system. This means that each digit in a hexadecimal number represents a power of 16. Hexadecimal numbers are often used in computing because they can represent large numbers in a compact form.

In the hexadecimal numbering system, the digits 0-9 represent the values 0-9, and the letters A-F represent the values 10-15. For example, the hexadecimal number 1A can be represented as:

$$1 \times 16^1 + A \times 16^0$$

In this representation, the first digit (1) represents 16 ($1 \times 16^1$), and the second digit (A) represents 10 (1$0 \times 16^0$). When you add these values together, you get the decimal number 26.

$$1 \times 16^1 + A \times 16^0 = 16 + 10 = 26$$

In addition to hexadecimal numbers, there are other numbering systems, such as [binary][Binary_Number] and [decimal][Decimal_Number], that are used in computing. However, hexadecimal numbers are particularly useful because they can represent large numbers in a compact form and are easy to convert to binary.

## Examples

The following table shows the decimal, binary & hexadecimal representations of the numbers 0 through 15:

| Decimal | Binary | Hexadecimal |
| ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 0       | 0000   | 0           |
| 1       | 0001   | 1           |
| 2       | 0010   | 2           |
| 3       | 0011   | 3           |
| 4       | 0100   | 4           |
| 5       | 0101   | 5           |
| 6       | 0110   | 6           |
| 7       | 0111   | 7           |
| 8       | 1000   | 8           |
| 9       | 1001   | 9           |
| 10      | 1010   | A           |
| 11      | 1011   | B           |
| 12      | 1100   | C           |
| 13      | 1101   | D           |
| 14      | 1110   | E           |
| 15      | 1111   | F           |
