An octal number is a number that uses the `base-8` numbering system. This means that each digit in an octal number represents a power of 8. Octal numbers are not as commonly used as [decimal][Decimal_Number] or [hexadecimal numbers][Hexadecimal_Number], but they are still used in some areas of computing.

In the octal numbering system, the digits 0-7 represent the values 0-7. For example, the octal number 123 can be represented as:

$$1 \times 8^2 + 2 \times 8^1 + 3 \times 8^0$$

In this representation, the first digit (1) represents 64 ($1 \times 8^2$), the second digit (2) represents 16 ($2 \times 8^1$), and the third digit (3) represents 3 ($3 \times 8^0$). When you add these values together, you get the decimal number 83.

$$1 \times 8^2 + 2 \times 8^1 + 3 \times 8^0 = 64 + 16 + 3 = 83$$

In addition to octal numbers, there are other numbering systems, such as [binary][Binary_Number] and [hexadecimal][Hexadecimal_Number], that are used in computing. However, octal numbers are not as commonly used as these other numbering systems.

## Examples

The following table shows the decimal, binary & octal representations of the numbers 0 through 7:

| Decimal | Binary | Octal |
| ------- | ------ | ----- |
| 0       | 000    | 0     |
| 1       | 001    | 1     |
| 2       | 010    | 2     |
| 3       | 011    | 3     |
| 4       | 100    | 4     |
| 5       | 101    | 5     |
| 6       | 110    | 6     |
| 7       | 111    | 7     |
