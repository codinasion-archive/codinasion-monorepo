A decimal number is a number that uses the `base-10` numbering system. This means that each digit in a decimal number represents a power of 10. For example, the number 1234 is a decimal number because it can be represented as:

$$1 \times 10^3 + 2 \times 10^2 + 3 \times 10^1 + 4 \times 10^0$$

In this representation, the first digit (1) represents 1,000 ($10^3$), the second digit (2) represents 200 ($2 \times 10^2$), the third digit (3) represents 30 ($3 \times 10^1$), and the fourth digit (4) represents 4 ($4 \times 10^0$). When you add these values together, you get the decimal number 1234.

$$1 \times 10^3 + 2 \times 10^2 + 3 \times 10^1 + 4 \times 10^0 = 1000 + 200 + 30 + 4 = 1234$$

In addition to decimal numbers, there are other numbering systems, such as [binary][Binary_Number] and [hexadecimal][Hexadecimal_Number], that are used in computing. However, decimal numbers are the most commonly used numbering system in everyday life and in computing.
