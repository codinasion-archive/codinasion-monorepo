title: What is a Binary Number?
description: "A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system, which uses only two digits: 0 and 1. This is in contrast to the decimal (base-10) numeral system that we use in everyday life, which uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9."

A binary number is a number expressed in the `base-2` numeral system, which uses only two digits: 0 and 1. This is in contrast to the [decimal][Decimal_Number] (`base-10`) numeral system that we use in everyday life, which uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

In the binary system, each digit represents a power of 2, starting with $2^0$ (which is equal to 1) and increasing by a factor of 2 for each successive digit. For example, the binary number 1011 represents:

$$1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11$$

Binary numbers are commonly used in computer science and digital electronics because they can be easily represented using electronic switches that are either on or off (i.e., 1 or 0). This makes them ideal for representing digital data, such as the instructions that a computer executes or the pixels in a digital image.

In addition to binary, there are other numeral systems that use different bases, such as [octal][Octal_Number] (`base-8`) and [hexadecimal][Hexadecimal_Number] (`base-16`). These systems are also commonly used in computer science and digital electronics because they can be easily converted to and from binary.

## Examples

The following table shows the decimal, binary representations of the numbers 0 through 15:

| Decimal | Binary |
| ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0000   |
| 1       | 0001   |
| 2       | 0010   |
| 3       | 0011   |
| 4       | 0100   |
| 5       | 0101   |
| 6       | 0110   |
| 7       | 0111   |
| 8       | 1000   |
| 9       | 1001   |
| 10      | 1010   |
| 11      | 1011   |
| 12      | 1100   |
| 13      | 1101   |
| 14      | 1110   |
| 15      | 1111   |
