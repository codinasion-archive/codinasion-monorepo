## What is Octal?

Octal is a number system that uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. It is also known as base 8 numbering system since it is based on 8 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

## What is Binary?

Binary is a number system that uses two digits: 0 and 1. It is also known as base 2 numbering system since it is based on 2 following symbols: 0 and 1.

## How to convert Octal to Binary?

To convert Octal to Binary, we need to convert each Octal value to it's Binary value using the Binary table.

### Example

Let's convert the Octal value `12` to Binary.

First, we need to convert each Octal value to it's Binary value.

| Octal Value | Binary Value |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 1           | 001          |
| 2           | 010          |

Now, we need to combine all the Binary values together to get the final Binary value. In this case, the final Binary value is `001010`. This is the Binary representation of the Octal value `12`.
