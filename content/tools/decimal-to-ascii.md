## What is Decimal?

Decimal is a number system that uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. It is also known as base 10 numbering system since it is based on 10 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.

## What is ASCII?

ASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.

## How to convert Decimal to ASCII?

To convert Decimal to ASCII, we need to convert each Decimal value to it's ASCII character using the ASCII table.

### Example

Let's convert the Decimal value `72 101 108 108 111` to ASCII.

First, we need to convert each Decimal value to it's ASCII character.

| Decimal Value | Character |
| ------------- | --------- |
| 72            | H         |
| 101           | e         |
| 108           | l         |
| 108           | l         |
| 111           | o         |

Now, we need to combine all the ASCII characters together to get the final ASCII value. In this case, the final ASCII value is `Hello`. This is the ASCII representation of the Decimal value `72 101 108 108 111`.
