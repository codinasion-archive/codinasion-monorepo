## What is Pascal Case?

Pascal case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized.

## What is Dot Case?

Dot case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is separated by a dot.

## How to convert Pascal Case String to Dot Case String?

To convert Pascal Case String to Dot Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to dot case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "HelloWorld" to Dot Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String     | Words        |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| HelloWorld | Hello, World |

Now, we need to convert each word to dot case.

| Words        | Dot Case Words |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Hello, World | hello.world    |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Dot Case String is `hello.world`. This is the Dot Case String representation of the string "HelloWorld".
