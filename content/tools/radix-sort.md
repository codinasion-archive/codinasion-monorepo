## What is Radix Sort?

Radix sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts a collection of elements by sorting the elements according to their radix.

## How to implement Radix Sort?

To implement radix sort, we need to sort the elements according to their radix.

### Example

Let's sort the collection `[3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1]` using radix sort.

First, we need to sort the elements according to their radix.

| Element | Radix |
| ------- | ----- |
| 1       | 1     |
| 2       | 2     |
| 3       | 3     |
| 4       | 4     |

The sorted collection is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
