## What is Octal?

Octal is a number system that uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. It is also known as base 8 numbering system since it is based on 8 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

## What is ASCII?

ASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.

## How to convert Octal to ASCII?

To convert Octal to ASCII, we need to convert each Octal value to it's ASCII character using the ASCII table.

### Example

Let's convert the Octal value `110 145 154 154 157` to ASCII.

First, we need to convert each Octal value to it's ASCII character.

| Octal Value | Character |
| ----------- | --------- |
| 110         | H         |
| 145         | e         |
| 154         | l         |
| 154         | l         |
| 157         | o         |

Now, we need to combine all the ASCII characters together to get the final ASCII value. In this case, the final ASCII value is `Hello`. This is the ASCII representation of the Octal value `110 145 154 154 157`.
