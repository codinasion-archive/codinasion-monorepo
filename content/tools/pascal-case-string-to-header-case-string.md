## What is Pascal Case?

Pascal case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized.

## What is Header Case?

Header case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized except the first word.

## How to convert Pascal Case String to Header Case String?

To convert Pascal Case String to Header Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to header case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "HelloWorld" to Header Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String     | Words        |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| HelloWorld | Hello, World |

Now, we need to convert each word to header case.

| Words        | Header Case Words |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| Hello, World | Hello, World      |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Header Case String is `Hello World`. This is the Header Case String representation of the string "HelloWorld".
