## What is Kebab Case?

Kebab case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is separated by a hyphen.

## What is Lower Case?

Lower case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is in lower case.

## How to convert Kebab Case String to Lower Case String?

To convert Kebab Case String to Lower Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to lower case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "hello-world" to Lower Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| hello-world | hello, world |

Now, we need to convert each word to lower case.

| Words        | Lower Case Words |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| hello, world | hello, world     |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Lower Case String is `hello world`. This is the Lower Case String representation of the string "hello-world".
