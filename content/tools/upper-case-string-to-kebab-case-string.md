## What is Kebab Case?

Kebab case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is separated by a hyphen.

## How to convert Upper Case String to Kebab Case String?

To convert Upper Case String to Kebab Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to kebab case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "HELLO WORLD" to Kebab Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| HELLO WORLD | HELLO, WORLD |

Now, we need to convert each word to kebab case.

| Words        | Kebab Case Words |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| HELLO, WORLD | hello, world     |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Kebab Case String is `hello-world`. This is the Kebab Case String representation of the string "HELLO WORLD".
