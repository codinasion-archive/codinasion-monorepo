## What is Hexadecimal?

Hexadecimal is a number system that uses sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F. It is also known as base 16 numbering system since it is based on 16 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.

## What is ASCII?

ASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.

## How to convert Hexadecimal to ASCII?

To convert Hexadecimal to ASCII, we need to convert each Hexadecimal value to it's ASCII character using the ASCII table.

### Example

Let's convert the Hexadecimal value `48 65 6C 6C 6F` to ASCII.

First, we need to convert each Hexadecimal value to it's ASCII character.

| Hexadecimal Value | Character |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| 48                | H         |
| 65                | e         |
| 6C                | l         |
| 6C                | l         |
| 6F                | o         |

Now, we need to combine all the ASCII characters together to get the final ASCII value. In this case, the final ASCII value is `Hello`. This is the ASCII representation of the Hexadecimal value `48 65 6C 6C 6F`.
