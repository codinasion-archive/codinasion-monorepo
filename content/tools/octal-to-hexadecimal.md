To convert Octal to Hexadecimal, we need to convert each Octal value to it's Hexadecimal value using the Hexadecimal table.

### Example

Let's convert the Octal value `12` to Hexadecimal.

First, we need to convert each Octal value to it's Hexadecimal value.

| Octal Value | Hexadecimal Value |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| 1           | 1                 |
| 2           | 2                 |

Now, we need to combine all the Hexadecimal values together to get the final Hexadecimal value. In this case, the final Hexadecimal value is `12`. This is the Hexadecimal representation of the Octal value `12`.
