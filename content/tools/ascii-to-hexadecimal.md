## What is ASCII?

ASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.

## What is Hexadecimal?

Hexadecimal is a number system that uses sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. It is also known as base 16 numbering system since it is based on 16 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.

## How to convert ASCII to Hexadecimal?

To convert ASCII to Hexadecimal, we need to convert each character to it's ASCII value, then convert that ASCII value to Hexadecimal.

### Example

Let's convert the word "Hello" to Hexadecimal.

First, we need to convert each character to it's ASCII value.

| Character | ASCII Value |
| --------- | ----------- |
| H         | 72          |
| e         | 101         |
| l         | 108         |
| l         | 108         |
| o         | 111         |

Now, we need to convert each ASCII value to Hexadecimal.

| ASCII Value | Hexadecimal Value |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| 72          | 48                |
| 101         | 65                |
| 108         | 6C                |
| 108         | 6C                |
| 111         | 6F                |

Finally, we need to combine all the Hexadecimal values together to get the final Hexadecimal value. In this case, the final Hexadecimal value is `48 65 6C 6C 6F`. This is the Hexadecimal representation of the word "Hello".
