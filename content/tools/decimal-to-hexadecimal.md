## What is Decimal?

Decimal is a number system that uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. It is also known as base 10 numbering system since it is based on 10 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.

## What is Hexadecimal?

Hexadecimal is a number system that uses sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F. It is also known as base 16 numbering system since it is based on 16 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.

## How to convert Decimal to Hexadecimal?

To convert Decimal to Hexadecimal, we need to divide the Decimal value by 16 until the quotient is 0. Then, we need to combine all the remainders together to get the final Hexadecimal value.

### Example

Let's convert the Decimal value `255` to Hexadecimal.

First, we need to divide the Decimal value by 16 until the quotient is 0.

| Decimal Value | Quotient | Remainder |
| ------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 255           | 15       | 15        |
| 15            | 0        | 15        |

Now, we need to combine all the remainders together to get the final Hexadecimal value. In this case, the final Hexadecimal value is `FF`. This is the Hexadecimal representation of the Decimal value `255`.
