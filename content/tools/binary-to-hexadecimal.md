## What is Binary?

Binary is a number system that only uses two digits: 1 and 0. Computers operate in binary, meaning they store data and perform calculations using only zeros and ones.

## What is Hexadecimal?

Hexadecimal is a number system that uses sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. It is also known as base 16 numbering system since it is based on 16 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.

## How to convert Binary to Hexadecimal?

To convert Binary to Hexadecimal, we need to convert each group of four binary digits to it's Hexadecimal value.

### Example

Let's convert the binary value `1001101` to Hexadecimal.

First, we need to split the binary value into groups of four binary digits.

| Binary Value | Grouped Binary Value |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| 1001101      | 0001 0011 01         |

Now, we need to convert each group of four binary digits to it's Hexadecimal value.

| Grouped Binary Value | Hexadecimal Value |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| 0001                 | 1                 |
| 0011                 | 3                 |
| 01                   | 1                 |

Finally, we need to combine all the Hexadecimal values together to get the final Hexadecimal value. In this case, the final Hexadecimal value is `131`. This is the Hexadecimal representation of the binary value `1001101`.
