## What is Sentence Case?

Sentence case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized.

## What is Upper Case?

Upper case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is uppercase.

## How to convert Sentence Case String to Upper Case String?

To convert Sentence Case String to Upper Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to uppercase, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "Hello World" to Upper Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Hello World | Hello, World |

Now, we need to convert each word to uppercase.

| Words        | Upper Case Words |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Hello, World | HELLO, WORLD     |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Upper Case String is `HELLO WORLD`. This is the Upper Case String representation of the string "Hello World".
