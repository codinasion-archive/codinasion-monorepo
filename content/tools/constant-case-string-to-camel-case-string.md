## What is Constant Case?

Constant case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized.

## What is Camel Case?

Camel case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized except for the first word.

## How to convert Constant Case String to Camel Case String?

To convert Constant Case String to Camel Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to lowercase, then join the words together with the first letter of each word capitalized.

### Example

Let's convert the string "HELLO_WORLD" to Camel Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| HELLO_WORLD | HELLO, WORLD |

Now, we need to convert each word to lowercase.

| Words        | Lowercase Words |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| HELLO, WORLD | hello, world    |

Finally, we need to join the words together with the first letter of each word capitalized. In this case, the final Camel Case String is `helloWorld`. This is the Camel Case String representation of the string "HELLO_WORLD".
