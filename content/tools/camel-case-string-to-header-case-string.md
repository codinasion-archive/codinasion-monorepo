## What is Camel Case?

Camel case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized except for the first word.

## What is Header Case?

Header case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized.

## How to convert Camel Case String to Header Case String?

To convert Camel Case String to Header Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to uppercase, then join the words together with a space.

### Example

Let's convert the string "helloWorld" to Header Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String     | Words        |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| helloWorld | hello, World |

Now, we need to convert each word to uppercase.

| Words        | Uppercase Words |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| hello, World | HELLO, WORLD    |

Finally, we need to join the words together with a space. In this case, the final Header Case String is `HELLO WORLD`. This is the Header Case String representation of the string "helloWorld".
