## What is Camel Case?

Camel case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized except for the first word.

## What is Sentence Case?

Sentence case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized except for the first word.

## How to convert Camel Case String to Sentence Case String?

To convert Camel Case String to Sentence Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to lowercase, then capitalize the first letter of each word, then join the words together with a space.

### Example

Let's convert the string "helloWorld" to Sentence Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String     | Words        |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| helloWorld | hello, World |

Now, we need to convert each word to lowercase.

| Words        | Lowercase Words |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| hello, World | hello, world    |

Next, we need to capitalize the first letter of each word.

| Lowercase Words | Capitalized Words |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| hello, world    | Hello, World      |

Finally, we need to join the words together with a space. In this case, the final Sentence Case String is `Hello World`. This is the Sentence Case String representation of the string "helloWorld".
