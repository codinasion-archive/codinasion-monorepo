## What is Constant Case?

Constant case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized.

## What is Snake Case?

Snake case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is lowercase and separated by an underscore.

## How to convert Constant Case String to Snake Case String?

To convert Constant Case String to Snake Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to lowercase, then join the words together with an underscore.

### Example

Let's convert the string "HELLO_WORLD" to Snake Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| HELLO_WORLD | HELLO, WORLD |

Now, we need to convert each word to lowercase.

| Words        | Lowercase Words |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| HELLO, WORLD | hello, world    |

Finally, we need to join the words together with an underscore. In this case, the final Snake Case String is `hello_world`. This is the Snake Case String representation of the string "HELLO_WORLD".
