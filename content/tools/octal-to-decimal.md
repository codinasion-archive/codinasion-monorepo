## How to convert Octal to Decimal?

To convert Octal to Decimal, we need to multiply each Octal value to it's place value and add all the results together.

### Example

Let's convert the Octal value `12` to Decimal.

First, we need to multiply each Octal value to it's place value.

| Octal Value | Place Value | Result |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 1           | $8^1$       | 8      |
| 2           | $8^0$       | 2      |

Now, we need to add all the results together to get the final Decimal value. In this case, the final Decimal value is `10`. This is the Decimal representation of the Octal value `12`.
