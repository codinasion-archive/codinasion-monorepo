## What is Lower Case?

Lower case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is in lower case.

## What is Constant Case?

Constant case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized.

## How to convert Lower Case String to Constant Case String?

To convert Lower Case String to Constant Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to constant case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "hello world" to Constant Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| hello world | hello, world |

Now, we need to convert each word to constant case.

| Words        | Constant Case Words |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| hello, world | HELLO, WORLD        |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Constant Case String is `HELLO_WORLD`. This is the Constant Case String representation of the string "hello world".
