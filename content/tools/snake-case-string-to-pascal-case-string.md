## What is Snake Case?

Snake case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is separated by an underscore.

## What is Pascal Case?

Pascal case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized except the first word.

## How to convert Snake Case String to Pascal Case String?

To convert Snake Case String to Pascal Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to pascal case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "hello_world" to Pascal Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| hello_world | hello, world |

Now, we need to convert each word to pascal case.

| Words        | Pascal Case Words |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| hello, world | Hello, World      |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Pascal Case String is `HelloWorld`. This is the Pascal Case String representation of the string "hello_world".
