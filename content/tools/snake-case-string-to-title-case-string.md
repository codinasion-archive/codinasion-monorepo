## What is Snake Case?

Snake case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is separated by an underscore.

## What is Title Case?

Title case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized.

## How to convert Snake Case String to Title Case String?

To convert Snake Case String to Title Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to title case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "hello_world" to Title Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| hello_world | hello, world |

Now, we need to convert each word to title case.

| Words        | Title Case Words |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| hello, world | Hello, World     |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Title Case String is `Hello World`. This is the Title Case String representation of the string "hello_world".
