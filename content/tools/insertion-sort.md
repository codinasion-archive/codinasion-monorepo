## What is Insertion Sort?

Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts a collection of elements by inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted collection.

## How to implement Insertion Sort?

To implement insertion sort, we need to insert each element into its correct position in the sorted collection.

### Example

Let's sort the collection `[3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1]` using insertion sort.

First, we need to insert each element into its correct position in the sorted collection.

| Element | Sorted Collection |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| 3       | 3                 |
| 2       | 2, 3              |
| 4       | 2, 3, 4           |
| 1       | 1, 2, 3, 4        |
| 2       | 1, 2, 2, 3, 4     |
| 1       | 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4  |

The sorted collection is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`.
