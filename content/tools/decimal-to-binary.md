## What is Decimal?

Decimal is a number system that uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. It is also known as base 10 numbering system since it is based on 10 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.

## What is Binary?

Binary is a number system that uses two digits: 0 and 1. It is also known as base 2 numbering system since it is based on 2 following symbols: 0 and 1.

## How to convert Decimal to Binary?

To convert Decimal to Binary, we need to divide the Decimal value by 2 until the quotient is 0. Then, we need to combine all the remainders together to get the final Binary value.

### Example

Let's convert the Decimal value `10` to Binary.

First, we need to divide the Decimal value by 2 until the quotient is 0.

| Decimal Value | Quotient | Remainder |
| ------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 10            | 5        | 0         |
| 5             | 2        | 1         |
| 2             | 1        | 0         |
| 1             | 0        | 1         |

Now, we need to combine all the remainders together to get the final Binary value. In this case, the final Binary value is `1010`. This is the Binary representation of the Decimal value `10`.
