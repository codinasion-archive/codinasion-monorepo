## What is Hexadecimal?

Hexadecimal is a number system that uses sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F. It is also known as base 16 numbering system since it is based on 16 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.

## What is Binary?

Binary is a number system that uses two digits: 0 and 1. It is also known as base 2 numbering system since it is based on 2 following symbols: 0 and 1.

## How to convert Hexadecimal to Binary?

To convert Hexadecimal to Binary, we need to convert each Hexadecimal value to it's Binary value using the Hexadecimal to Binary table.

### Example

Let's convert the Hexadecimal value `48 65 6C 6C 6F` to Binary.

First, we need to convert each Hexadecimal value to it's Binary value.

| Hexadecimal Value | Binary Value |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| 48                | 01001000     |
| 65                | 01100101     |
| 6C                | 01101100     |
| 6C                | 01101100     |
| 6F                | 01101111     |

Now, we need to combine all the Binary values together to get the final Binary value. In this case, the final Binary value is `01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111`. This is the Binary representation of the Hexadecimal value `48 65 6C 6C 6F`.
