## What is Header Case?

Header case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized except the first word.

## What is Sentence Case?

Sentence case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized except the first word.

## How to convert Header Case String to Sentence Case String?

To convert Header Case String to Sentence Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to sentence case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "Hello World" to Sentence Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Hello World | Hello, World |

Now, we need to convert each word to sentence case.

| Words        | Sentence Case Words |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Hello, World | Hello, world        |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Sentence Case String is `Hello world`. This is the Sentence Case String representation of the string "Hello World".
