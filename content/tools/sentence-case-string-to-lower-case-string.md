## What is Sentence Case?

Sentence case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized.

## What is Lower Case?

Lower case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is written in lower case.

## How to convert Sentence Case String to Lower Case String?

To convert Sentence Case String to Lower Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to lower case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "Hello World" to Lower Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Hello World | Hello, World |

Now, we need to convert each word to lower case.

| Words        | Lower Case Words |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Hello, World | hello, world     |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Lower Case String is `hello world`. This is the Lower Case String representation of the string "Hello World".
