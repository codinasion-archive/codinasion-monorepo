## What is ASCII?

ASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.

## What is Decimal?

Decimal is a number system that uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. It is also known as base 10 numbering system since it is based on 10 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.

## How to convert ASCII to Decimal?

To convert ASCII to Decimal, we need to convert each character to it's Decimal value using the ASCII table.

### Example

Let's convert the word "Hello" to Decimal.

First, we need to convert each character to it's Decimal value.

| Character | Decimal Value |
| --------- | ------------- |
| H         | 72            |
| e         | 101           |
| l         | 108           |
| l         | 108           |
| o         | 111           |

Now, we need to combine all the Decimal values together to get the final Decimal value. In this case, the final Decimal value is `72 101 108 108 111`. This is the Decimal representation of the word "Hello".
