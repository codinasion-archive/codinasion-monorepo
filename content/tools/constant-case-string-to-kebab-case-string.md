## What is Kebab Case?

Kebab case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is lowercase and separated by a hyphen.

## How to convert Constant Case String to Kebab Case String?

To convert Constant Case String to Kebab Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to lowercase, then join the words together with a hyphen.

### Example

Let's convert the string "HELLO_WORLD" to Kebab Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| HELLO_WORLD | HELLO, WORLD |

Now, we need to convert each word to lowercase.

| Words        | Lowercase Words |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| HELLO, WORLD | hello, world    |

Finally, we need to join the words together with a hyphen. In this case, the final Kebab Case String is `hello-world`. This is the Kebab Case String representation of the string "HELLO_WORLD".
