## What is Dot Case?

Dot case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is separated by a dot.

## What is Constant Case?

Constant case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized.

## How to convert Dot Case String to Constant Case String?

To convert Dot Case String to Constant Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to constant case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "hello.world" to Constant Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| hello.world | hello, world |

Now, we need to convert each word to constant case.

| Words        | Constant Case Words |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| hello, world | HELLO, WORLD        |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Constant Case String is `HELLO_WORLD`. This is the Constant Case String representation of the string "hello.world".
