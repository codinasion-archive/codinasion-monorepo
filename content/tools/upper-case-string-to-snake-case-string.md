## What is Upper Case?

Upper case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized.

## What is Snake Case?

Snake case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is separated by an underscore.

## How to convert Upper Case String to Snake Case String?

To convert Upper Case String to Snake Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to snake case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "HELLO WORLD" to Snake Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| HELLO WORLD | HELLO, WORLD |

Now, we need to convert each word to snake case.

| Words        | Snake Case Words |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| HELLO, WORLD | hello_world      |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Snake Case String is `hello_world`. This is the Snake Case String representation of the string "HELLO WORLD".
