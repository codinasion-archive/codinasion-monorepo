## What is Pascal Case?

Pascal case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized.

## How to convert Camel Case String to Pascal Case String?

To convert Camel Case String to Pascal Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to uppercase, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "helloWorld" to Pascal Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String     | Words        |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| helloWorld | hello, World |

Now, we need to convert each word to uppercase.

| Words        | Uppercase Words |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| hello, World | HELLO, WORLD    |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Pascal Case String is `HelloWorld`. This is the Pascal Case String representation of the string "helloWorld".
