## What is Header Case?

Header case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized except the first word.

## What is Path Case?

Path case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is separated by a slash.

## How to convert Header Case String to Path Case String?

To convert Header Case String to Path Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to path case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "Hello World" to Path Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Hello World | Hello, World |

Now, we need to convert each word to path case.

| Words        | Path Case Words |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Hello, World | hello/world     |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Path Case String is `hello/world`. This is the Path Case String representation of the string "Hello World".
