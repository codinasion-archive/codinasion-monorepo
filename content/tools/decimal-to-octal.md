## What is Decimal?

Decimal is a number system that uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. It is also known as base 10 numbering system since it is based on 10 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.

## What is Octal?

Octal is a number system that uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. It is also known as base 8 numbering system since it is based on 8 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

## How to convert Decimal to Octal?

To convert Decimal to Octal, we need to divide the Decimal value by 8 until the quotient is 0. Then, we need to combine all the remainders together to get the final Octal value.

### Example

Let's convert the Decimal value `10` to Octal.

First, we need to divide the Decimal value by 8 until the quotient is 0.

| Decimal Value | Quotient | Remainder |
| ------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 10            | 1        | 2         |
| 1             | 0        | 1         |

Now, we need to combine all the remainders together to get the final Octal value. In this case, the final Octal value is `12`. This is the Octal representation of the Decimal value `10`.
