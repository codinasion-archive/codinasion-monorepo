## What is Selection Sort?

Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts a collection of elements by selecting the smallest element in the collection and then swapping it with the first element in the collection.

## How to implement Selection Sort?

To implement selection sort, we need to select the smallest element in the collection and then swap it with the first element in the collection.

### Example

Let's sort the collection `[3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1]` using selection sort.

First, we need to select the smallest element in the collection and then swap it with the first element in the collection.

| Element | Selection | Swap |
| ------- | --------- | ---- |
| 3       | 1         | 1    |
| 2       | 1         | 1    |
| 4       | 1         | 1    |
| 1       | 1         | 1    |
| 2       | 1         | 1    |
| 1       |           |      |

The sorted collection is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`.
