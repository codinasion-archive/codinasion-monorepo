## What is Upper Case?

Upper case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized.

## How to convert String to Upper Case?

To convert String to Upper Case, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to upper case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "hello world" to Upper Case.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| hello world | hello, world |

Now, we need to convert each word to upper case.

| Words        | Upper Case Words |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| hello, world | HELLO, WORLD     |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Upper Case String is `HELLO WORLD`. This is the Upper Case String representation of the string "hello world".
