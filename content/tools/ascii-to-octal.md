## What is ASCII?

ASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.

## What is Octal?

Octal is a number system that uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. It is also known as base 8 numbering system since it is based on 8 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

## How to convert ASCII to Octal?

To convert ASCII to Octal, we need to convert each character to it's ASCII value, then convert that ASCII value to Octal.

### Example

Let's convert the word "Hello" to Octal.

First, we need to convert each character to it's ASCII value.

| Character | ASCII Value |
| --------- | ----------- |
| H         | 72          |
| e         | 101         |
| l         | 108         |
| l         | 108         |
| o         | 111         |

Now, we need to convert each ASCII value to Octal.

| ASCII Value | Octal Value |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 72          | 110         |
| 101         | 145         |
| 108         | 154         |
| 108         | 154         |
| 111         | 157         |

Finally, we need to combine all the Octal values together to get the final Octal value. In this case, the final Octal value is `110 145 154 154 157`. This is the Octal representation of the word "Hello".
