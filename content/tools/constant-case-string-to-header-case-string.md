## What is Constant Case?

Constant case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized.

## What is Header Case?

Header case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized except for the first word.

## How to convert Constant Case String to Header Case String?

To convert Constant Case String to Header Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to title case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "HELLO_WORLD" to Header Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| HELLO_WORLD | HELLO, WORLD |

Now, we need to convert each word to title case.

| Words        | Title Case Words |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| HELLO, WORLD | Hello, World     |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Header Case String is `Hello World`. This is the Header Case String representation of the string "HELLO_WORLD".
