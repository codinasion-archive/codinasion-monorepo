## What is Lower Case?

Lower case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is in lower case.

## What is Upper Case?

Upper case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is in upper case.

## How to convert Lower Case String to Upper Case String?

To convert Lower Case String to Upper Case String, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to upper case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "hello world" to Upper Case String.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| hello world | hello, world |

Now, we need to convert each word to upper case.

| Words        | Upper Case Words |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| hello, world | HELLO, WORLD     |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Upper Case String is `HELLO WORLD`. This is the Upper Case String representation of the string "hello world".
