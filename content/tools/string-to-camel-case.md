## What is Camel Case?

Camel case is a naming convention in which a word or phrase is written without spaces between words and each word is capitalized except the first word.

## How to convert String to Camel Case?

To convert String to Camel Case, we need to split the string into words, then convert each word to camel case, then join the words together.

### Example

Let's convert the string "hello world" to Camel Case.

First, we need to split the string into words.

| String      | Words        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| hello world | hello, world |

Now, we need to convert each word to camel case.

| Words        | Camel Case Words |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| hello, world | hello, World     |

Finally, we need to join the words together. In this case, the final Camel Case String is `helloWorld`. This is the Camel Case String representation of the string "hello world".
