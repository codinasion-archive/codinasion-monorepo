## How to convert Hexadecimal to Octal?

To convert Hexadecimal to Octal, we need to convert each Hexadecimal value to it's Octal value using the Hexadecimal to Octal table.

### Example

Let's convert the Hexadecimal value `48 65 6C 6C 6F` to Octal.

First, we need to convert each Hexadecimal value to it's Octal value.

| Hexadecimal Value | Octal Value |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| 48                | 110         |
| 65                | 145         |
| 6C                | 154         |
| 6C                | 154         |
| 6F                | 157         |

Now, we need to combine all the Octal values together to get the final Octal value. In this case, the final Octal value is `110 145 154 154 157`. This is the Octal representation of the Hexadecimal value `48 65 6C 6C 6F`.
