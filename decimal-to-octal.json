It is also known as base 10 numbering system since it is based on 10 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.\n\n## What is Octal?\n\nOctal is a number system that uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. It is also known as base 8 numbering system since it is based on 8 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.\n\n## How to convert Decimal to Octal?\n\nTo convert Decimal to Octal, we need to divide the Decimal value by 8 until the quotient is 0. Then, we need to combine all the remainders together to get the final Octal value.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the Decimal value `10` to Octal.\n\nFirst, we need to divide the Decimal value by 8 until the quotient is 0.\n\n| Decimal Value | Quotient | Remainder |\n| ------------- | -------- | --------- |\n| 10            | 1        | 2         |\n| 1             | 0        | 1         |\n\nNow, we need to combine all the remainders together to get the final Octal value. In this case, the final Octal value is `12`. This is the Octal representation of the Decimal value `10`.\n"}
