{"slug":"hexadecimal-to-binary","markdown":"\n## What is Hexadecimal?\n\nHexadecimal is a number system that uses sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F. It is also known as base 16 numbering system since it is based on 16 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.\n\n## What is Binary?\n\nBinary is a number system that uses two digits: 0 and 1. It is also known as base 2 numbering system since it is based on 2 following symbols: 0 and 1.\n\n## How to convert Hexadecimal to Binary?\n\nTo convert Hexadecimal to Binary, we need to convert each Hexadecimal value to it's Binary value using the Hexadecimal to Binary table.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's convert the Hexadecimal value `48 65 6C 6C 6F` to Binary.\n\nFirst, we need to convert each Hexadecimal value to it's Binary value.\n\n| Hexadecimal Value | Binary Value |\n| ----------------- | ------------ |\n| 48                | 01001000     |\n| 65                | 01100101     |\n| 6C                | 01101100     |\n| 6C                | 01101100     |\n| 6F                | 01101111     |\n\nNow, we need to combine all the Binary values together to get the final Binary value. In this case, the final Binary value is `01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111`. This is the Binary representation of the Hexadecimal value `48 65 6C 6C 6F`.\n"}
